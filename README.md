## DEPENDENCIES
**vega**'s dependencies are designed to very minimal:

- A GNU/Linux operating system
- A POSIX compliant shell
- libpci
- GCC

## INSTALLATION

Install:

    make install

Uninstall

    make remove


Also remove `~/.config/vega/config.sh` (`make remove` does not do this)

## CONFIGURATION

The main config file is located at `/etc/vega.d/config.sh`
Run `vega --installconf` to install a copy to your user config directory (this will override the systemwide config)
